//! Centralized event names and helpers for consistent event emission.
//!
//! This module provides a single source of truth for event names used throughout
//! the contract, reducing string duplication and ensuring consistency across
//! event emission paths.
//!
//! ### Event Schema Stability
//!
//! Downstream indexers rely on the stable ordering of fields in event payloads.
//! When modifying event structures:
//! - **Do not reorder** existing fields.
//! - **Add new fields** only at the end of the structure to maintain compatibility.
//! - **Avoid removing fields**; if a field is deprecated, keep it with a default value.
//!
//! This approach ensures that indexers can reliably parse event data across
//! different contract versions.
//!
//! ### Horizon Event Encoding
//!
//! Events are consumed off-chain through the Stellar Horizon / Soroban RPC
//! event stream, which decodes topics and data as ScVal types:
//! - The first topic of every event is a `Symbol` from the `*_EVENT_NAME`
//!   constants in this module (at most 9 characters, via `symbol_short!`).
//!   Never publish a raw `String` as a topic.
//! - Remaining topics are `Address` or integer (`u32`) identifiers, built by
//!   the shared `*_topics` helpers.
//! - Event data is a `#[contracttype]` struct (encoded as an ScVal map) or a
//!   plain ScVal value; every struct documents its topics and fields under
//!   "Event shape" in this module.
//! - Events without a dedicated struct carry a plain value as data:
//!   `pause`, `unpause`, `blk_add`, `blk_rem` (`()`), `dl_set` (deadline
//!   ledger `Option<u32>`), `ttl_ext` (new live-until ledger `u32`),
//!   `gpause_on` / `gpause_of` (ledger `u32`), `poll_new` (expiry ledger) and
//!   `poll_vote` (`(option_index, weight)`).
//!
//! ### Quote-Related Event Field Semantics
//!
//! - `supply`: Number of keys in circulation after the trade (for buy/sell events)
//! - `payment`: Total amount paid by the buyer (for buy events, ≥ key price)
